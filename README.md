## Approach Used:
- I used Tailwind CSS for this task, so as to practise with the CSS framework and become more proficient.
- Installed and configured tailwind with npm.
- Created html and javascript files and configured accordingly.
- made a layout of the page with html and proceeded to style using tailwind utility classes, and a bit of custom css in the input.css of tailwind.
